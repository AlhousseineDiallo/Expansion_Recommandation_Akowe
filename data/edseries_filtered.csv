Learning Outcomes,PIAAC: Mean Adult Literacy Proficiency. Total,"Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential. Literacy encompasses a range of skills from the decoding of written words and sentences to the comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation of complex texts. It does not, however, involve the production of text (writing). Information on the skills of adults with low levels of proficiency is provided by an assessment of reading components that covers text vocabulary, sentence comprehension and passage fluency. The target population for the survey was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. Literacy-related non-respondents are not included in the calculation of the mean scores which, thus, present an upper bound of the estimated literacy proficiency of the population. For more information, consult the OECD PIAAC website: http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/"
Learning Outcomes,PIAAC: Adults by literacy proficiency level (%). Level 1,"Percentage of adults scoring 176 to less than 226 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. Most of the tasks at this level require the respondent to read relatively short digital or print continuous, non-continuous, or mixed texts to locate a single piece of information that is identical to or synonymous with the information given in the question or directive. Some tasks, such as those involving non-continuous texts, may require the respondent to enter personal information onto a document. Little, if any, competing information is present. Some tasks may require simple cycling through more than one piece of information. Knowledge and skill in recognizing basic vocabulary determining the meaning of sentences, and reading paragraphs of text is expected. The target population for the survey was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. The percentage of adults scoring at different levels of proficiency adds up to 100% when the percentage of literacy-related non-respondents are taken into account. Adults in this category were not able to complete the background questionnaire due to language difficulties or learning and mental disabilities (literacy-related non-response). For more information, consult the OECD PIAAC website: http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/"
Learning Outcomes,PIAAC: Adults by literacy proficiency level (%). Level 2,"Percentage of adults scoring 226 to less than 276 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. At this level, the medium of texts may be digital or printed, and texts may comprise continuous, non-continuous, or mixed types. Tasks at this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrasing or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present. Some tasks require the respondent to either A) cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria; B) compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question; or C) navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document. The target population for the survey was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. The percentage of adults scoring at different levels of proficiency adds up to 100% when the percentage of literacy-related non-respondents are taken into account.

Learning Outcomes,PIAAC: Adults by literacy proficiency level (%). Level 3,"Percentage of adults scoring 276 to less than 326 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, and include continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages of text. Understanding text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multi-step operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or inappropriate content to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information. The target population for the survey was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status.

Learning Outcomes,PIAAC: Adults by literacy proficiency level (%). Level 4,"Percentage of adults scoring 326 to less than 376 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. Tasks at this level often require respondents to perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesize information from complex or lengthy continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple type texts. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge may be needed to perform the task successfully.

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States."

Divide government expenditure on a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary) by total government expenditure on education (all levels combined), and multiply by 100. A high percentage of government expenditure on education spent on a given level denotes a high priority given to that level compared to others. When interpreting this indicator, one should take into account enrolment at that level, and the relative costs per student between different levels of education. For more information, consult the UNESCO Institute of Statistics website: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/"
Expenditures,Government expenditure per secondary student as % of GDP per capita (%),"Average total (current, capital and transfers) general government expenditure per student in the given level of education, expressed as a percentage of GDP per capita.

Expenditures,Expenditure on education as % of total government expenditure (%),"Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure on all sectors (including health, education, social services, etc.). It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Public education expenditure includes spending by local/municipal, regional and national governments (excluding household contributions) on educational institutions (both public and private), education administration, and subsidies for private entities (students/households and other privates entities). In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refers only to the ministry of education and can exclude other ministries that spend a part of their budget on educational activities. The indicator is calculated by dividing total public expenditure on education incurred by all government agencies/departments by the total government expenditure and multiplying by 100. For more information, consult the UNESCO Institute of Statistics website: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/"
Expenditures,Government expenditure on education as % of GDP (%),"Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Divide total government expenditure for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) by the GDP, and multiply by 100. A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries.
